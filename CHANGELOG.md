# pupa changelog

## 0.7.0 - May 25 2017

Backwards-incompatible changes:

* moves from split dependency of opencivicdata-divisions/opencivicdata-django
  to new unified opencivicdata which also splits into two Django apps
  (see python-opencivicdata release notes for more detail)

Improvements:

* allow Memberships to have unresolved `person_name` similar to how other
  name resolutions work
* allow linking of VoteEvent to BillAction by setting a matching chamber,
  date, and bill\_action
* add Scraper.latest\_session convienience method
* optionally allow setting \_scraped\_name on legislative\_session, which will
  be used in session\_list checking if present
* allow fuzzy datetimes to be used for action.date

Fixes:

* pupa dbinit --reset now correctly drops dependent pupa tables and migrations
* exit gracefully if the first scrape fails instead of complaining about RunPlan
  DB constraint
